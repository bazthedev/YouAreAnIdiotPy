# YouAreAnIdiotPy
### thank you hamza for the moving window code
## This is my attempt at a python port of you are an idiot, there are some issues but it works!

## FEATURES:
- Moving Windows
- Displays Image
- Plays sound
- Messageboxes
- Closing a window spawns more

## ISSUES:
- Windows move very slowly when there are lots on screen, so stick to 0-30.
